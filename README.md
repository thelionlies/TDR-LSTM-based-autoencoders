This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a technical paper for experiments on 
Tagalog Diacritic Restoration (TDR) using LSTM-based autoencoders. The dataset is 
based on articles from the Sari-Samot blogs by Filipino author Virgilio Almario, 
enhanced with diacritized homographs for accurate diacritic restoration.
