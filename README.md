This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a technical paper for experiments on 
Tagalog Diacritic Restoration (TDR) using LSTM-based autoencoders. The dataset is 
based on articles from the Sari-Samot blogs by Filipino NA Virgilio Almario, 
which has diacritized homographs.

This work was completed for the Pattern Recognition class in the MDSc program at Ateneo de Manila University.
