This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a technical paper for experiments on 
Tagalog Diacritic Restoration (TDR) using LSTM-based autoencoders. The dataset is 
based on articles from the Sari-Samot blogs by Filipino NA Virgilio Almario, 
enhanced with diacritized homographs for accurate diacritic restoration.

This work was completed for the Pattern Recognition class in the MDSc program at Ateneo de Manila University.
